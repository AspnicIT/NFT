            Many modern artists have a weakness for our smaller brothers, making them the central 
            figures of their works. Today you can buy a painting in an animalistic style at almost any art exhibition.
            It can be a soothing image of a pet in a beautiful interior, 
            which will add comfort to the atmosphere of the house. 
            A completely different mood conveys the image of the deadly fight of wild animals. 
            Such a picture will certainly add energy and dynamics.`,
